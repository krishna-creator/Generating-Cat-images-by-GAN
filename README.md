# Cat Image Generation Using GANs

## Overview

This project demonstrates the generation of cat images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model includes both the Generator and Discriminator networks, trained to create realistic images from random noise. The training process leverages two types of loss functions: the original GAN loss and the Least Squares GAN loss.

## Loss Functions Implemented

### GAN Loss

The standard GAN loss functions used in this project are:

- **Generator Loss**:
$$
\ell_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}\left[\log D(G(z))\right]
$$

- **Discriminator Loss**:
$$
\ell_D = -\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_\text{data}}\left[\log D(x)\right] - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}\left[\log \left(1-D(G(z))\right)\right]
$$

### Least Squares GAN Loss

An alternative loss function from the [Least Squares GAN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04076):

- **Generator Loss**:
$$
\ell_G = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}\left[\left(D(G(z)) - 1\right)^2\right]
$$

- **Discriminator Loss**:
$$
\ell_D = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_\text{data}}\left[\left(D(x) - 1\right)^2\right] + \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}\left[\left(D(G(z))\right)^2\right]
$$

## How GANs Work

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks: the Generator and the Discriminator. The Generator creates fake images from random noise, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images. The two networks are trained simultaneously: the Generator aims to improve its ability to produce realistic images, while the Discriminator improves its ability to identify fake images.
